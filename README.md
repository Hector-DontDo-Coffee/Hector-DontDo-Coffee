ABOUT ME:

- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hector-DontDo-Coffee, but call me Hector if you'd prefer!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning game development, using code to simulate physics, and all that wacky stuff you can do with just some 1's and some 0's.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals in the TOP curriculum, and I've taken introductory college classes on both Python and C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing right now ... we're not there yet.
- 📫 If you're looking to have a chat with me, feel free to add me on Discord at HectorLikesEggnog#9073

Thank you very much - I look forward to collaborating!
